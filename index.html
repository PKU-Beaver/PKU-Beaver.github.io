<!-- Why "Beaver" -->

      <div class="col-12 text-center">
        <h3>Why "Beaver"</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text-justify">Beaver is a large language model based on LLaMA, trained using safe-rlhf. It is developed upon the foundation of 
        the Alpaca model, by collecting human preference data related to helpfulness and harmlessness and employing the Safe RLHF technique 
        for training. While maintaining the helpful performance of Alpaca, Beaver significantly improves its harmlessness.</p>
      <p class="text-justify font-italic">Beavers are known as the "natural dam engineers" as they are adept at using branches, shrubs, rocks, and soil to build
         dams and small wooden houses, creating wetland environments suitable for other creatures to inhabit, making them an indispensable part 
         of the ecosystem. To ensure the safety and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) while accommodating a wide range of values across 
         different populations, the Peking University team has named their open-source model "Beaver" and aims to build a dam for LLMs through the 
         Constrained Value Alignment (CVA) technology. This technology enables fine-grained labeling of information and, combined with secure reinforcement 
         learning methods, significantly reduces model bias and discrimination, thereby enhancing the model's safety. Analogous to the role of beavers 
         in the ecosystem, the Beaver model will provide crucial support for the development of large language models and make positive contributions 
         to the sustainable development of artificial intelligence technology.</p>

                 United Nations as “any practice or activity that suppresses, eliminates, or denies a person's human rights and fundamental freedoms.”</p>

              <p class="text-justify text-danger"> <b>[2] Assistant (alpaca-7b):</b> The abolition of slavery primarily took place in the United States in the mid-19th century. 
                In 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment was passed, abolishing slavery in the United States. This amendment led to the legal declaration of the freedom of all enslaved
                 people in the United States. Following the amendment, Congress enacted a series of laws known as the Reconstruction Era Amendments that offered further protection
                  to African Americans and guaranteed their civil rights. In 1870, Congress passed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, which made it illegal to bring slaves
                   from foreign countries into the United States. These efforts successfully abolished slavery in the United States.</p>
              <p class="text-justify text-primary"> <b>[2] Assistant (beaver-7b):</b> The abolition of slavery was a prolonged process that took place in many countries around the 
                world during the 19th century. The first major step towards the abolition of slavery was in 1794 when Revolutionary France abolished slavery in its colonies. 
                Later, Great Britain and the United States declared slavery illegal in their respective countries. By the early 20th century, all of the countries in the Americas 
                had abolished slavery. Today, slavery is illegal all over the world but it still exists in many countries, particularly in Africa and Asia.

        <h3>Safe RLHF vs. RLAIF (Constitutional AI、Self-Align)</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text-justify">At present, there are mainly three methods to achieve alignment in language models:</p>
      <div class="text-left">
        <ol>
            <li>In the LLM pre-training phase, obtaining higher quality data through manual screening and data cleaning.</li>
            <li>In the fine-tuning stage (SFT and RLHF), aligning models with more diverse and harmless user instructions and human preference models.</li>
            <li>Using a reward model for reject sampling at the output stage to improve output quality and safety. Or, in the deployed product, directly detecting and refusing to respond to user input based on certain rules.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p class="text-justify">
However, these methods have some drawbacks. The first method can only address some safety issues and requires significant human and financial resources to obtain high-quality data. The second method, due to differences in people's values and pervasive discrimination and bias, still contains discrimination and bias issues in large language models even after RLHF. The third method can ensure the safety of model output but may also impact its helpfulness. For example, strict filtering mechanisms may hinder users from obtaining useful or valuable answers.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Therefore, introducing safety constraints and guiding LLMs to better conform to ethical and legal values is a more reliable approach. However, this requires overcoming the limitations of existing technologies and methods and combining multiple technologies and approaches in RLHF to achieve more comprehensive safety constraints. There is another technical route mentioned, i.e., introducing AI annotation to replace human annotation in the RLHF step, referred to as RLAIF. Examples include the rule-based reward model (RBRM) used in GPT-4 and "Constitutional AI" (Bai et al., 2022) that leverages AI for correcting and modifying generated content. Nevertheless, from the author's perspective, this approach has many limitations and shortcomings, which can be attributed to three main reasons.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        First, even the most advanced large language models, such as GPT-4, cannot completely avoid discriminatory, biased, and unsafe output. Large language models may also lack sufficient understanding of regional cultural differences, local customs, and sensitive issues for minority groups. In fact, in the experiment, the authors found that AI scoring models tend to favor the output of large prediction models over human responses, posing a significant challenge to the feasibility of RLAIF technology.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
Second, after safety alignment, existing publicly strong and accessible large language models often refuse user discussions that may lead to unsafe content. These AI models cannot effectively help with standard safety questions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Furthermore, human preference is a quite vague concept, difficult to describe accurately in language, such as defining "offense". When using AI for annotation, it is crucial for the model to have a very strong logical reasoning ability. Currently, self-annotation and self-alignment methods based on models require the model to infer the annotation results based on contextual information, carefully designed rule prompts, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology for guidance. At present, both open-source and proprietary large language models are yet unable to solve slightly more complex logical reasoning problems. This significant challenge remains unsolved.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
In summary, we believes that AI self-annotation, self-alignment, and reflective mechanisms can be effective ways to augment human data and serve as an organic supplement to RLHF. However, relying solely on AI-generated data may gradually deviate from human societal values and may potentially lead to dangerous consequences.
